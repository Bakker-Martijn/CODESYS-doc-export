                convert the value to an integer for the choice which was selected.

              - For the MultipleChoicePrompt methods, you can

            * - A tuple <:class:`PromptResult` member, :class:`PromptChoiceFilter` delegate>
              - Some prompts present a list with possibly multiple selectable
                choices, and return a Prompt Result. For those prompts, a
                PromptResult is accepted as value (with results in none of the

                2 elements: a :class:`PromptResult` followed by a :class:`PromptChoiceFilter`
                delegate which allows the script for fine grained selection.
